Learning another programming language

## Learning another language after Python

This is a short guide to other programming languages for those who are familiar wth Python. There are many reasons why those familiar with Python might wish to use another programming language, here a a few -

* contributing to a project using a different language
* programming devices such as mobile phones or internet of things

## Choosing another programming language

Most likely the next programming language you learn after Python will be decided by your circumstances, but will almost certainly fall into one of the following groups.

### The C/C++/C#/Java/Rust family

These are all compiled languages based on the C programming language.

### JavaScript, TypeScript, CoffeeScript and NodeJS

JavaScript has a syntax very much like the C/Java family but is an interpreted language like Python. TypeScript and CoffeeScript provide extra features and *compile* to JavaScript.

### R

R is an interpreted statistical language.

## Compiled or interpreted

If you're unsure of the distinction between compiled and interpreted languages see https://hackernoon.com/compilers-and-interpreters-3e354a2e41cf

## Other languages

For the time being I'm not including examples of these programming languages.

* Go

* F#

* PHP

* Perl

* Fortran

* Rexx/NetRexx/ooRexx

Other legacy languages such as COBOL and the many flavours of BASIC really aren't worth covering here.  If you have
a need to use, or even just read, these languages your knowledge of Python will stand you in good stead.
