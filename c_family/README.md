# C language family

These languages are all compiled. When using compiled languages there is typically two stages to building an *executable* program, the first being *compilation* and the second being *linking*.

## The entry point

When you write a program in a compiled language it is necessary to provide an *entry point*, in C like languages this is typically a function called *main*. This is where your program starts and ends.
